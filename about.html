                <p class="containedParagraph">Hi, I'm Josh. I'm an aspiring software developer with a knowledge of C++, Python, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. From a young age, I've always been interesting in all things computing, but especially how they're applied in the real world. I'm an avid gamer, who loves to play the latest releases as soon as they come out, so I have a fairly extensive knowledge of video games, but I have not applied it to a career yet. I'm hoping to begin working for a software company in the near future.<br><br>
                    My time with Computer Science has been both a fulfilling one, and one that has left me wanting more. Even before I was taught in secondary school, I can vividly remember pestering my mother to purchase me books on Lua and Java so that I could figure out how to add functionality to my ROBLOX places, or start making mods for Minecraft. When I was finally able to begin a course at my local college, my fascination only grew.<br><br>
                    I find learning new languages, or the intricacies of a piece of technology, an incredibly rewarding experience, and one that I have had a lot of opportunity to experience while studying Computer Science. I am not content to stop at one language or one type of system though, as there is always more to learn, and that can really only ever be a good thing.<br><br>
                    As a Software Engineer, I wish to contribute to society in a way that I can really be proud of. I hope to work with teams that really value collaboration, and allow me to work alongside my colleagues to make our ideas a reality. I've been fortunate enough to already get experience of working with people of different backgrounds, and I'd love to have more opportunities to work on projects with a diverse range of people, to see just how well we can come together to solve a problem.<br><br>
                    Computer Science is an incredible field, and I look forward to being a part of the future.<br><br>
                    This site, then, exists as my landmark on the great World Wide Web; a proof of concept, a portfolio, and a place where I can share what I have created and what I am currently creating.<br><br>
                    <em>This site runs on a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the most popular frontend languages out there.</em></p>
